sound
- interpolation = sinc-hann (8-tap, 4096 points) + hermite (4-tap)
- interpolation = larger buffer history (sinc quality)
- interpolation = use previous 4 samples (better clarity)
- interpolation = clear buffer before voice on (reduce popping)
- interpolation = move pitch update timing (accurate sampling)
- interpolation = remove 1-bit masking (extra precision)
- interpolation = remove pre-clamping (extra precision)

- resampler = raw + sinc-hann (small post-audio clarity)



libretro
- feature = audio oversampling (192K @ 32-bit, 384K @ 64-bit)
- feature = color correction (sameboy crt)
- feature = hi-res transparency blending (merge, blur) [Kirby's Dreamland 3, Jurassic Park, few others]
- feature = post-render pixel format (32-bpp)
- feature = video cropping (larger borders)
- feature = volume sliders (master, msu-1)
- feature = 8-tap controller
- feature = hardware toggling (graphics layers, sound channels)

- optimize = remove blargg rendering (better shader performance)
