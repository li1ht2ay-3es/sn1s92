sound
- oversampling = 192K (32-bit) or 384K (64-bit)

- interpolation = sinc hann window (8-tap, 4096 points) + hermite (4-tap)
- interpolation = larger buffer history (8-tap sinc quality)
- interpolation = use previous 4 samples (better clarity)
- interpolation = clear buffer before voice on (reduce popping)
- interpolation = move pitch update timing (accurate sampling)
- interpolation = remove hermite upsampling (use frontend filter)
- interpolation = remove 1-bit masking (extra precision)
- interpolation = remove pre-clamping (extra precision)



libretro
- feature = larger cropping
- feature = master volume slider
- feature = msu-1 volume slider
- feature = 8-tap controller
- feature = graphics layer toggling
- feature = sound channel toggling

- optimize = remove blargg rendering (better shader performance)
